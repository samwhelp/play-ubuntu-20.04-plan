```
Many places in openbox that take a coordinate supports a slightly extended format.
Most simply it can be just a number such as 300.
Such a coordinate will be left- or top-aligned depending on which coordinate it is.
To align to the opposite edge, use -300.
To specify a negative offset, a - is also used,
so you have to use +-10 to offset 10 pixels negatively to the left/top and --10 for the right/bottom edge.
Some things enforce being onscreen though, such as the move/resize popup.
